            <span className='text-rose-500  '>Front End Web Developer</span> with a strong background in media studies and media production.
            Iâ€™m interested in learning more about <span className='text-rose-500  '>UX/UI</span> principles as I believe this will help to enhance my understanding of Front End Web Development.
            My goal is to develop responsive and beautiful <span className='text-rose-500 '>Web Pages & Apps</span> which offer the user interface elements and interactions that facilitate usability and boost engagement.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I've been always driven by creativity. I'm passionate about music, so much that I went all the way to the UK to study <span className='text-rose-500  '>Music Engineering and Production</span>.
            I love films, TV series and videogames (specially RPGs). I love learning about tech in general and I'm always interested in the latest news regarding software and hardware.
